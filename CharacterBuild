		/*
		NOTES ON THE METHOD
		Method intention is to simply print out stats from an array list stored from the 2 arrays in CharacterBuild
		Main abilities and Side Abilities.
		Best way to implement the array into the program/story is to offer a choice during any point of the game where the player
		is able to chose either (in the main method)
		
		I dont remember if its either int[] mainAbilities or simply mainAbilities when using the method in Main
		
		check main abilities CheckStats(int[] mainAbilities)
		check side abilities CheckStats(int[] sideAbilities)
		or both abilities CheckStats{int[] mainAbilities, int [] sideAbilites)
		To make the information easier to read, add a print line of the abilitys names before using the CheckStats() method
		Example:
		While loopFlag = False
			if (kchoice == 1)
				//Does something for the story
				loopFlag = True
			...
			if (kchoice == 5) //checks mainAbilities only
				System.out.println("Strength, Speed, Reflex")
				CheckStats(int[] mainAbilities)
				loopFlag == False //Allows user to sill pick a choice
			if (kchoice == 6)
				System.out.println("Strength, Speed, Reflex")
				CheckStats(int[] sideAbilities)
				loopFlag == False //Allows user to sill pick a choice
			if (kchoice == 7) // checks side abilities only
				System.out.println("Leadership, Charm, Confidence")
				CheckStats(int [] sideAbilities)
				loopFlag == False //Allows user to sill pick a choice
			if (kchoice == 8)// checks both abilties
			System.out.println("Strength, Speed, Reflex")
				CheckStats(int [] mainabilities, int[] sideAbilities)
				loopFlag == False //Allows user to sill pick a choice
				
		Ask me if you need help implementing these methods into the code.
